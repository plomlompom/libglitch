libglitch makes 8-bit sounds in the spirit of viznut's [“algorithmic symphonies”][1], using a small language not entirely unlike Forth. Included is a small programm reading formulas from the command line. GNU/Linux users may try “./glitter.py 'glitch_machine!a10k4h1f!aAk5h2ff!aCk3hg!ad3e!p!9fm!a4kl13f!aCk7Fhn' | aplay -f u8” for playback.

Using sox, sound can easily be exported into wave files: “./glitter.py `cat tracks/sidekick.glitch` | head -c128000 | sox -c 1 -r 8000 -t u8 - sidekick.wav”.

For editing and visual effects, try “./glitched.py [filename]”. Controls are the arrow keys (to move the cursor around), page up / page down (to change the opcode), space (to for no opcode), t (for the counter) and all hexadecimal digit keys (for insertion of the corresponding characters). Symbol keys (plus, minus etc.) may also work.

In glitched, press F4 to switch between waveform and stack visualisation. F5, F6, F7, F8 provide finer control over visualisation options. Press all of them in order to see a stack visualisation. F9 shows the current value of the counter (“t”).

libglitch is inspired by a [comment from madgarden][2], who kindly provided the [opcodes][3] he uses in his iOS application [“Glitch Machine”][4] and [some source code][5]. There is also a [Scala implementation][6].
